# 🏟️ Digital Transaction Model of the Sports Industry Chain Based on Blockchain Technology

## 📌 Overview

This project explores a **blockchain-based digital transaction model** designed specifically for the **sports industry value chain**. The sports industry is undergoing rapid digital transformation, yet traditional transaction models are often hindered by centralized control, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies in revenue distribution.

Our model leverages **blockchain technology**, including **smart contracts** and **distributed ledger technology (DLT)**, to improve the security, efficiency, and fairness of financial interactions between stakeholders such as **athletes**, **clubs**, **sponsors**, and **fans**.
